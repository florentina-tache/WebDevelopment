Everyone has this <b>voice</b> inside,

00:04.000 --> 00:07.000 align:start line:-1
the one that tells us there's more to life,

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000 align:start line:-1
but it takes courage to believe in it,
listen to it and take action.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.500 align:start line:-1
The best part is,

00:17.000 --> 00:22.000 align:start line:-1
leaping off the cliff is actually how we actually learn to fly.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.000
When I first started travelling the world I had no idea how it would work out.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.500
I just knew that I wanted to live an extraordinary life.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
I knew there were other people who traveled the world

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
and did work they loved

00:43.000 --> 00:45.500
and I wanted to create a life like that.

00:45.500 --> 00:47.500
A life where I felt alive!

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
And I spent my days doing things that felt meaningful to me.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
My heart knew it was possible.

00:56.500 --> 00:58.500
My mind was afraid.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
I knew I had to give it a shot.

01:04.500 --> 01:08.200
So, one day at a time, I chose love over fear.

01:08.200 --> 01:09.500
And it happened.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
It's happening.
